TailorMade:
(By Team MAD-T085)
Face or Object recognition can be done by methods like Haar Cascades but it has its limitation.
The face is recognized within a rectangular box and the exact boundary of objects are not recognized.
Hence, we have used the BackgroundSubtraction module from the package 'OpenCV'.
Using that, the objects or surroundings which are non-moving are perceived as black pixels and the moving parts are
perceived as white pixels.By placing ourselves in front a stable background and record a video of ourselves for about 6-10
seconds, all the while moving our body subtly.This video is processed with the "BackgroundsubtractorMOG2()"
and the output is stored as a video.Images of each frame of the latter video is extracted through python.
Now the frame with optimal boundary conditions is taken as the standard for measuring height and width.
Two such images are taken - a frontal image and one on the sideways. Using Tensorflow, we can recognize differents parts
as head,hand,leg,shoulder etc. Now the ratio proportions of each parts are obtained such as length-width ration of face,
abdomen,waist etc.By knowing the ratio between pixels and inches, we can identify the actual size of body. Hence allowing
the program to surf through a clothing database to provide us with suitable and fitting clothes.
